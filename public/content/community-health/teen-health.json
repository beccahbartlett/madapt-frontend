Some girls/women experience these worse or for longer than others.</p><p></p><p><strong>Pads:</strong></p><ul><li>A pad is a rectangular piece of material that you can attach to the inside of your underwear. It absorbs the blood as it flows out of the vagina.</li><li>Some pads have extra material on the side (called wings) that fold over the edges of your underwear to help hold the pad in place and prevent leakage.</li><li>Some girls have periods with heavier bleeding, whereas some girls only experience light bleeding. Pads come in different thicknesses to suit heavier and lighter periods.</li><li>Peel the strip underneath the pad and then press it onto the inside of your underwear to attach it.</li><li>Once you have removed the pad after going to the toilet, wrap it in toilet paper and throw it into a rubbish bin (or sanitary bin if there is one located in the bathroom).</li><li>You should change your pad every 3 - 4 hours to prevent any odours or infections developing.</li></ul><p><strong>Tampons:</strong></p><ul><li>A tampon soaks up blood from inside the vagina.</li><li>Before inserting a tampon remember to wash your hands.</li><li>Follow the instructions that come with the tampon packet and make sure you relax as you insert the tampon.</li><li>Some tampons come with an applicator that guides the tampon into the vagina. Other tampons are inserted with your fingers.</li><li>Tampons have a string attached to the end that stays outside of the vagina. This string is used to remove the tampon.</li><li>A tampon should be changed every 4 - 6 hours.</li><li>Once you have removed the tampon after going to the toilet, wrap it in toilet paper and throw it into a rubbish bin (or sanitary bin if there is one located in the bathroom).</li><li>If you can not find the string, wash your hands and gently use your fingers to locate it within the vagina (<strong>don&rsquo;t worry, a tampon cannot get lost because your cervix will block it from travelling any further</strong>).</li></ul><p><strong>Menstrual Cups:</strong></p><ul><li>A menstrual cup is a bell-shaped, silicon cap that can be inserted into the vagina during your period.</li><li>The cup catches the blood before it flows out of the vagina.</li><li>To insert, fold is in half like the picture below and insert. If inserted properly the menstrual cup should not be uncomfortable and will not fall out.</li><li>Follow the instructions here if you are unsure</li><li>The cup can be left inside between 6-12 hours depending on the heaviness of your flow though most brands recommend emptying and cleaning every 6 hours to reduce the chance of infection (see TSS section below)</li><li>You need to have access to soap and water so that you can wash your hands before you remove and reinsert the cup.</li><li>At the end of your cycle, you can wash your cup with warm water and an oil free, unscented soap.</li><li>If you wish to boil it, you can do so for 5-10 minutes but be careful to to let the cup get burned as this will make it unusable in the future.</li><li>With good care, you cup can last up to 10 years.</li></ul><p><strong>Toxic Shock Syndrome</strong></p><ul><li>Toxic Shock Syndrome happens when bacteria in the vagina become poisonous.</li></ul><p>Symptoms:</p><ul><li>High temperature</li><li>Low blood pressure</li><li>Rash that looks like sunburn</li><li>Vomiting or diarrhoea</li><li>Muscle aches or weakness</li><li>Bright red colouring of the eyes, mouth, throat and vagina</li><li>Headache, confusion, disorientation or seizures</li><li>Pain in your abdomen (tummy) and back (near your kidneys)</li></ul><p><strong>If you notice any of these symptoms contact your doctor immediately.</strong></p><p>More information can be found here, scroll to the bottom of the page to find this information in other languages</p><p><a href='https://www.fpnsw.org.au/health-information/periods/menstrual-cycle-and-period-problems'>Menstrual Cycle and Period Problems</a></p><p><a href='https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/toxic-shock-syndrome'>Toxic Shock Syndrome</a></p>",
