        "en": "<p>If you’re experiencing an unplanned pregnancy, you can access confidential services which will provide you with support, counseling, and referrals. Such services, which are also provided by the Royal Women’s Hospital, can help you make an informed decision about your pregnancy by exploring some of your options including keeping the baby, adoption, and abortion.</p>   <p>Adoption: Adoption is a process where a child becomes a member of a new family. Making the child to give up a child for adoption is never easy, but sometimes parents can decide that adoption is best for their baby. After adoption, parents give up all legal rights and obligations to their baby. Adoptions process in Victoria can be started through the Department of Human Services or an approved adoption agency. </p> <p>Abortion: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy, which can be done surgically or medically. Most abortions are performed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, while some are performed up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. In some rare cases, abortion can be performed up to 36 weeks of pregnancy. Australian law on abortion varies by state, however in Victoria, you have the right to have an abortion for up to 24 weeks of pregnancy and two doctors must agree that an abortion is required beyond 24 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions should always be performed by a trained medical practitioner. </p> ",
