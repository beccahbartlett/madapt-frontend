It can also include oral sex, anal sex and masturbation.  Some people may even define sex as any sexual activity.  When it comes to sex it's important that you make sure that the sex you have is always done safely. Safe sex means that you make sure your body fluids and your partner's body fluids (semen, vaginal fluids and blood) don't come into contact with each other's bodies. If you're having sex, you can keep it safe by doing 2 things:</p><ol>  <li><b>Make sure that you always use a condom.</b>The safest way to have sex is to use condoms. If you're having sex, condoms are the only form of protection that can help stop the transmission of STIs and at the same time prevent unplanned pregnancies.</li>  <li><b>Make sure you get tested for STIs regularly</b>Getting tested is quick, easy and painless. So, do it often. Getting tested for STIs should be part of your normal health check-up.  If you're having sex and have never been tested for an STI, it's a good idea to get tested now. If you've had sex with someone without a condom, or you're experiencing any of the typical symptoms, you should see your doctor about testing.</li></ol><p>Do these 2 things and you're doing the best you can to protect yourself and your partners from sexually transmissible infections (STIs).</p><p>Additional things to think about:</p><ul>  <li>You can't tell if someone has an STI based on how they look, where they're from or who they have slept with.</li>  <li>Planning ahead and taking condoms with you, means you'll not have to worry later.</li>  <li>Think its awkward asking your partner to wear a condom? Imagine finding out you've got an STI...</li>  <li>Using a condom provides you with peace of mind and lets you enjoy the process!</li>  <li>Condoms can prevent you from catching HIV.</li>  <li>People with STIs often don't know they're infected, so protect yourself just in case.</li></ul>",
