    "en": "<p>You have the right to be treated with respect in your relationship with your partner.</p><p>Healthy relationships are based on kindness and caring for one another.</p><p>Healthy relationships never involve physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Having a partner that is intimidating, manipulative, or controlling are also forms of abuse.</p><p>Everyone, regardless of their religion, culture, age, ability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, has the right to live free from abuse and has the right to legal protection.</p><p>If you feel that you are in an unhealthy relationship there are some resources that can help you. However, if you are in immediate danger please call 000.</p><h2>Consensual sex</h2><p>Consensual sex is when both parties are of legal age, agree to engage in sexual intercourse by choice, and have the freedom and capacity to make that choice. This means agreeing to sexual relations without fear, coercion, force or intimidation.</p><p>Giving consent is active, not passive. It means freely choosing to say “yes” and also being free to change your mind at any time.</p><p>Having sex with someone under age is a crime. It is also a crime to have a sexual relationship with someone underage where there is a relationship of authority; for example, a teacher with a student or an employer with an employee.</p><p>Regardless of age, if someone has been unable to give consent to sexual relations and they have taken place, it is a crime. People unable to give consent are those who are:</p><ul>  <li>unconscious</li>  <li>asleep</li>  <li>intoxicated</li>  <li>drugged</li>  <li>have a psychological or decision-making disability that impacts on their ability to understand what they are consenting to.</li></ul><p>If you have a friend or know someone who is a victim of sexual assault and would like to learn more about how you can support them, watch this video to get some ideas.</p>",
