If they are born between 28-32 weeks they are called very premature. If they are born between 32-36 weeks they are called moderately premature. And, if they are born 36-37 weeks they are called late preterm. The earlier that a baby is born the higher risk the baby is and the longer they will need to spend in the neonatal intensive care unit.<br><br>",
